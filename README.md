- Jupyter Notebook

## Tasks
- Checked the basic measures of descriptive statistics
- Checked missing values, missing values using , Combining two dataframes w.r.t country code, Checking Data Types, Finding different countries and number of records of those specific countries, Finding all the countries name w.r.t to specific records, Finding the total number of records for that particular country name, Creating a pie chart of top 3 countries using Zomato, Observations: 94.39% of zomato partnered restaurants are in India, 4.73% in US and 0.87% in UK.

Maximum number of ratings are between 2.5 and 3.4, Making count plot w.r.t rating color, Combining two dataframes w.r.t country code, Sorting the dataframe(final_df) by "Aggregate rating", Extracting the unique values of Country column, Finding the country names that has given 0 ratings, Observation: Maximum number of zero ratings are from Indian customers Finding out which currency is used by which country, Finding the countries that have online delivery option, Observation: Online deliveries are available in India and UAE In India and UAE, some areas online delivery is not there Create a pie chart for cities distribution, Finding top 10 cuisines
